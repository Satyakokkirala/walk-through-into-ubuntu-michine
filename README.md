# Penetration Testing Report

This report provides a detailed walkthrough of a penetration testing (pentesting) exercise conducted on an Ubuntu machine. The report outlines the steps taken to identify vulnerabilities and provides recommended mitigation techniques.

## Introduction

Penetration testing (pentesting) is a simulated cyber attack on a computer system performed to evaluate its security. The primary goal of this pentesting exercise was to identify vulnerabilities in an Ubuntu machine and recommend mitigation strategies to enhance its security posture.

## Environment

- **Target Machine**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Tools Used**: Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and other common pentesting tools
- **Methodology**: Following the standard phases of pentesting - Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploitation, and Post-exploitation

## Walkthrough

### 1. Reconnaissance

In the reconnaissance phase, we gathered information about the target machine to understand its architecture and identify potential attack vectors.

- **Tools Used**: Nmap, OSINT tools
- **Actions**: Performed network mapping and service enumeration

### 2. Scanning

In the scanning phase, we conducted various scans to discover open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Tools Used**: Nmap, Nessus
- **Actions**: 
  - Conducted a port scan to identify open ports
  - Performed service version detection
  - Ran vulnerability scans to identify known issues

### 3. Exploitation

In the exploitation phase, we attempted to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the target machine.

- **Tools Used**: Metasploit, ExploitDB
- **Actions**: 
  - Used known exploits to target vulnerable services
  - Gained shell access to the machine

### 4. Post-exploitation

In the post-exploitation phase, we gathered information from the compromised machine and assessed the extent of the breach.

- **Tools Used**: Metasploit, custom scripts
- **Actions**: 
  - Retrieved sensitive information
  - Evaluated the impact of the breach
  - Documented findings

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

- **Weak SSH Credentials**: The target machine had weak SSH credentials, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Outdated Software**: Several services were running outdated versions with known vulnerabilities.
- **Misconfigured Services**: Certain services were misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access.

## Mitigation Techniques

- **Strong Password Policies**: Implement strong password policies and enforce the use of complex passwords.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update software and services to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Service Configuration**: Properly configure services to minimize exposure and reduce the attack surface.
- **Network Segmentation**: Segment the network to limit access to sensitive systems and data.

## Conclusion

This pentesting exercise revealed several vulnerabilities in the target Ubuntu machine. By addressing these issues and implementing the recommended mitigation techniques, the overall security posture of the system can be significantly improved.
